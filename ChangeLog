Release 1.0.1 - 06.11.2015
INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES
- Requires firmware version 2 and logic revision 7449.
- usb.h: improved caerDeviceDataStart() API to also allow for
  notification of data acquisition shutdown, to be able to react
  to abnormal shutdown cases, like when a device is unplugged.
- frame.h: changed in-memory format for easier handling and compatibility
  with the other event formats (all-in-one memory block).
- davis.h: rename DAVIS240 APSOVERFLOWLEVEL to APSOVERFLOWLEVELBN.

NEW FEATURES
- Headers are C++ compatible and stand-alone now.
- MacOS X support.
- Added pkg-config file for library.
- Full API documentation (see docs/ for PDF).
- Various cmake/build improvements. Support out-of-tree builds.
- Add iterator macros for EventPackets.
- frame.h: added ROI region ID tracking, as well as ROI position.
  Added caerFrameEventGetExposureLength() and caerFrameEventGetTimestamp(),
  which is defined as the median of the exposure times.
  Added caerFrameEventPacketGetPixelsSize() and caerFrameEventPacketGetPixelsMaxIndex()
  for EventPacket-level size information.
  Added caerFrameEventGetPixelsSize() and caerFrameEventGetPixelsMaxIndex()
  for Event-level size information.
- log.h: added caerLogFileDescriptorsSet() to allow logging to
  up to two different file descriptors (defaults to STDERR only).
- davis.h: added chipID check macros.
- davis.h: added DAVIS_CONFIG_APS_SNAPSHOT to take one frame snapshots.
- dvs128.h: added DVS128_CONFIG_DVS_TS_MASTER to select timestamp
  master or slave behavior (timestamp synchronization).
- davis_common.c: added support for outputting only reset read or
  signal read frames, for debugging purposes.
- c11threads_posix.h: C11-compatible thread abstraction, for
  both Linux and MacOS X, based on POSIX Threads.

BUG FIXES
- Relaxed atomic operations memory constraints for better
  performance on weakly-ordered architectures (like ARM).
- log.c: call tzset() before localtime_r(), as per standard.
- davis_common.c: improved Region of Interest support (APS).
- davis_fx2.c: keep GlobalShutter flag correctly in-sync.
- davis_fx3.c: fixed support for new FX3 devices.
- packetContainer.h: handle container being NULL by returning NULL.
